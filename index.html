            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I am a computer science <span id="college-status">status</span> at the University of New Hampshire
                in Durham. I enjoy programming and have been studying software development for <span
                    id="coding-years">some time</span>. I also enjoy creating and playing music. I play most woodwinds
                and some percussion. I was a member of the University of Hartford's GHYWE group for three years, where I
                played Alto Saxophone and Bb Clarinet.
            </p>

            <h2>Software Skills</h2>
            <p>
                I have experience with many programming languages, including C, C++, Java, Python, Go, Rust, and
                JavaScript. I've worked with some frameworks such as React and Django, and can create full-stack web
                apps from scratch, using only the language-provided libraries for most non-niche tasks. I have
                experience with SQL and structured databases, including using MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. I
                have used tools like Docker, Bamboo, Bitbucket, GitHub, and GitLab for CI/CD and version control. I have
                a lot of experience with both Linux and Windows as desktop OSes and server OSes.
            </p>

            <h2>Hardware & Networking Skills</h2>
            <p>
                I got into hardware in high school by repairing old laptops and desktop computers. After that, I picked
                up a Raspberry PI to run linux on and that's how I got into home labbing. More information on what's in
                my lab, check out the <a href="#projects">projects</a> section. I have experience in networking, through
                my homelab and through my work. I have experience with MikroTik, Cisco, Ubiquiti UniFi, and Mellanox
                networking equipment. I really enjoy the security aspect of both software and hardware, and I think that
                running my own lab is a good way of learning practically.
            </p>

                <h2>Homelab</h2>
                <p>
                    I am an enthusiast of homelabbing. I have a server rack in my room with a few servers and some
                    networking equipment.
                    This lab also provides internet to my desktop and other devices I have via ethernet. Currently, I am
                    running bare-metal
                    Ubuntu 24.04 LTS on my servers. I am mainly running a private Minecraft server and working on
                    training CERSE, a project
                    listed below. I have plans to start a cluster using Proxmox on my servers, and implement proper
                    infrastructure soon.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am considering using LDAP and IPA for user management, as well as writing an Ansible playbook to
                    automate the setup
                    of new virtual machines and servers. I will also run my own DNS server and a VPN server for remote
                    access into the lab.
                    I still plan on running a minecraft server for friends and maybe some other game servers, since it's
                    a good way to bring
                    people together for some fun.

                <p>
                    CERSE, Central Engine for Resource and System Efficiency, is a modern datacenter management
                    tool. It is designed to
                    manage anything from a simple homelab to a large scale cluster of datacenters. Built in Go,
                    CERSE is lightweight and
                    efficient. The core of CERSE is a simple app that collects information from systems via IPMI,
                    SSH, and BMC tools and
                    stores it in a compressed format in a database. This data is then interpreted both by algorithms
                    and a custom written
                    machine learning model to provide insights into the efficiency of the datacenter, and to catch
                    potential issues before
                    they become problems. Results can be accessed via a CLI interface and a web panel which is
                    neately designed to fit on
                    all types of devices. The web panel also comes with a fancy panel slideshow design for
                    quick-glance metrics to put on
                    a large screen. Additionaly CERSE can be accessed through voice control, and can interpret basic
                    sentences into questions
                    and in some cases, instructions. CERSE can also perform basic tasks on machines in your lab
                    through its connected tools.
                    You can organize your resources into groups, which can have recursive subgroups. CERSE is the
                    perfect tool to connect your
                    infrastructure.
